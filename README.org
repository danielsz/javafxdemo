* JavaFX demo

The source code in this repository was generated by a [[https://meyvn.org/][Meyvn]] template. It is featured in a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMuCYPGqitk][video]] explaining how to build and live code with Meyvn and JavaFX.

The POM file is not part of the template and needs to be created by running ~myvn -x pom~. In the ~meyvn.edn~ configuration file, the ~:interactive~ must be disabled so as not to include development-time facilities. When live coding, you can turn it back on.
